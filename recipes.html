                <h2>Recipes from India</h2>
                <h3><a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/easy-butter-chicken">1. Butter Chicken</a></h3>
                <p> Butter chicken is mouth-watering, tender chicken, cooked in a spiced tomato sauce. It’s
                    traditionally
                    cooked in a tandoor (a cylindrical clay or metal oven), but may be grilled, roasted or pan-fried in
                    less
                    authentic preparations.

                    Always make the gravy by first cooking fresh tomato, garlic, and cardamom down into a bright red
                    pulp.
                    This pulp is then pureed after cooling. Then, the chef adds butter, various spices, and Khoa (dried
                    whole milk).</p>

                    <h3>2. Samosas (Deep-Fried Potato/Veggie Dumpling)</h3>
                </a>


                <p>Samosas are a very popular traditional Indian Dish. Probably because samosas are a tasty, fried, or
                    baked
                    pastry with savory fillings.

                    Spiced potatoes, onions, peas, and lentils fill traditional samosas. But sometimes, they are made
                    with
                    ground lamb, ground beef or ground chicken.

                    Good news for all of you Indian food lovers and solely plant-based eaters. Indian samosas are
                    usually
                    vegan! That means the pastry is free of eggs and dairy products..</p>

                    <h3>1.Dumplings</h3>
                </a>
                <p> Dumpling has been an indispensable Chinese dish of the reunion dinner on Chinese New Year’s Eve,
                    especially in the northern regions. It was invented by Zhang Zhongjing – the sage of Chinese
                    medicine
                    over 1,800 years ago to cure the frostbitten ears. Nowadays, people mix minced pork, chicken,
                    mutton, or
                    beef with chopped vegetables to make the filling, and then wrap it into a thin piece of dumpling
                    skin
                    and pinch the wrapper into the shape of an ear. On Chinese New Year, people also wrap brown sugar,
                    coins, dates, or peanuts for a good omen..</p>

                <p>Kung Pao Chicken, definitely one of the top 10 Chinese dishes, is a popular dish not only among
                    Chinese people. Its special flavor of sweet and sour with a little bit spicy is also well-liked
                    abroad
                    and this course even becomes the byword for Chinese cuisine for most foreigners. The main ingredient
                    of
                    Kung Pao Chicken is the diced chicken. Stir-frying the chicken with peanuts and dried chili can make
                    it
                    tastes fresh and crispy, spicy but not burning..</p>

                <h2>Recipes from Fiji</h2>
                <a href="https://www.tasteatlas.com/most-popular-dishes-in-fiji">
                    <h3>1. Vakalavalava </h3>
                </a>
                <p>Vakalavalava is a Fijian dessert made with grated fresh cassava, shredded coconut, sugar, and butter.
                    The
                    sweet cassava mixture is baked in a pan, and it can optionally be topped with sweetened condensed
                    milk,
                    custards, creams, or syrups. This cassava-based dessert is often enriched with mashed bananas or
                    coconut
                    milk.

                    Often referred to as cassava cake, this dessert is typically reserved for afternoon and evening tea,
                    but
                    it can also be eaten for breakfast. Vakalavalava is considered a take on vakalolo, a steamed Fijian
                    pudding, both of which are based on cassava, called tavioka in Fiji.

                <p>Best consumed warm, these semi-sweet buns are a Fijian delicacy that is extremely easy to prepare.
                    The
                    dough consists of flour, sugar, butter, and eggs. When it is kneaded and smooth, it is divided into
                    smaller buns which are then arranged into a baking pan, covered with coconut milk, and baked until
                    golden brown in color.

                    Lolo buns can be consumed on their own or paired with a cup of hot cocoa.</p>

                    tortilla
                    are usually made larger and thinner because the gluten in the flour allows the dough to be

                    Stuffed with chicken, these burritos are definitely a treat for your taste buds.

                <p>Bolo de brigadeiro is a traditional Brazilian cake that's a staple at birthday parties. The cake
                    consists
                    of three layers of tender and moist crumb, chocolate cake, and the fudgy brigadeiro filling and
                    frosting
                    that's made with a combination of condensed milk, table cream, margarine, chocolate powder, full fat
                    milk, and cornstarch.

                    The base layer is made with sugar, butter, oil, eggs, vanilla, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder,
                    baking soda, and whole milk. Once assembled and frosted, this cake is decorated with chocolate
                    sprinkles
                    on all sides. Some people also like to decorate this decadent chocolate cake with a few brigadeiro
                    balls
                    on top.

                    <h3>2. Moqueca</h3>
                </a>
                <p>Moqueca is a seafood stew with a base of palm oil and coconut milk or olive oil, combined with fish
                    or
                    shrimps (or both). The dish is stewed in traditional clay pots along with vegetables and fresh
                    herbs,
                    and it is traditionally served over rice.

                    It can be traced back to 300 years ago, when it was first invented due to the fact that the
                    Portuguese
                    brought coconuts to the country, and slaves from Africa introduced palm oil to Brazilian cuisine.
                    There
                    are numerous versions of moqueca, such as moqueca Capixaba, or moqueca Baiana, from the Bahia state
                    in
                    the northeast of the country.

                    The dish is traditionally garnished with fresh chopped cilantro on top, while crusty bread provides
                    the
                    best accompaniment.

                    <h3>1. Sandwich de lomo</h3>
                </a>
                <p>This is an extreme version of a steak sandwich – filled with thinly sliced lomo steak, tomatoes,
                    onions,
                    lettuce, mayonnaise, chimichurri sauce, ham, cheese, and a fried egg, sandwich de lomo or lomito is
                    a
                    behemoth of a sandwich that is sure to satiate even the hungriest consumers.

                    However, this delicious sandwich is open to innovation – some might substitute the steak with pork,
                    or
                    put aubergine slices into it, along with any other ingredient that comes to mind. Popular both in
                    Argentina and Uruguay, it can easily be found at numerous street carts dispersed throughout the
                    metropolitan areas of both countries.

                    <h3>2. Medialunas</h3>
                </a>
                <p>These soft crescent rolls are regarded as the Argentinian take on traditional French croissants. Even
                    though they are very similar to the French variety, medialunas are slightly more moist, smaller, and
                    a
                    bit sweeter. There are two traditional types of medialunas; the larger version made with butter, and
                    the
                    smaller version made with lard.

                    Both varieties are usually prepared plain, with a rum-and-sugar glaze on top. They are traditionally
                    eaten for breakfast, ideally accompanied by a cup of strong coffee with milk, or as an afternoon
                    snack
                    served with yerba mate, a traditional Argentinian herbal tea.

                    Argentinians prefer to eat them with sweet condiments, jellies, dulce de leche, or chocolate
                    spreads.
                    Even though they are easily prepared at home, medialunas can also be bought in
                    panaderias–traditional
                    bakeries found throughout Argentina.

                    <h3>1. Arepas</h3>
                </a>
                <p>Venezuelan cuisine is incredibly rich and diverse, but, as the popular saying goes: “There’s nothing
                    more
                    Venezuelan than an arepa”.

                    Arepas are these sort of small pitas made with corn flour and filled with a variety of ingredients.
                    Beans, cheese, rice, pork, eggs… It depends on the region and the creativity of the cook (or,
                    sometimes,
                    the leftovers in the fridge). You can eat them as a main dish or as a side and they are perfect for
                    breakfast, lunch or even dinner!

                </a>
                <p>Quesillo is similar to Spanish and
                    Mexican flan.

                    However, the Venezuelan recipe uses the whole egg instead of the yolk, so it makes it even creamier
                    and
                    less watery. Quesillo has a texture similar to pudding, just firmer and more consistent.
                    Additionally,
                    it has a delicious caramel sauce at the top that makes my mouth water by just writing about it.

                </a>
                <p>Fish and chips is an iconic British classic that's hard to beat. Cod or haddock is battered and fried
                    until the fish is tender and the coating golden and crispy, making for a delicious crunch on every
                    bite. But wait too long after frying and it can be limp and greasy. That’s why frying times are
                    usually posted in the shop. You can find a solid fish and chip shop almost anywhere in the U.K.

                </a>
                <p>Olivier salad is a Russian salad with variable ingredients, but it is typically made with chopped
                    vegetables, meat, and mayonnaise. The key ingredients include diced potatoes, vegetables, eggs,
                    chicken, or ham. This salad is one of the most important appetizers at the New Year's salad buffets
                    in Russia, as well as in some of the other countries of the former USSR.

                    The original was invented in the 1860s by Lucien Olivier, a chef in the popular Moscow restaurant
                    called L'Hermitage. Olivier guarded the recipe until he died, but it is believed that the recipe was
                    stolen by an employee who watched the chef at work, so the salad is still made today.

                </a>
                <p>Russian golubtsy are cabbage rolls stuffed with ground beef that is combined with either rice or
                    buckwheat. However, not only rice and meat may be used as a filling, as cabbage stuffed with any
                    ingredient is the only necessary component for the dish to be called golubtsy.

                    The name of the dish means little pigeons, referring to the 18th-century aristocratic practice of
                    grilling doves. The poor people couldn't afford it, so they started cooking fake doves, or golubtsy.
                    This dish is traditionally accompanied by a dollop or two of sour cream on the side.

                    <h3>1. Bratwurt</h3>
                </a>
                <p>Bratwurst has origins with the Celtics, but the Franconians developed it further. It dates back to
                    the 1300s in a region that would eventually become Eastern Germany. Bratwurst is usually consumed
                    for breakfast, due to the tradition of farmers who would make the sausages in the morning and eat
                    them by noon, as they would otherwise spoil.

                    Technically, a bratwurst must be made from either pork, veal, or beef, but there are more than 40
                    varieties of the sausage throughout Germany. The oldest recipe for bratwurst was discovered in 2000
                    by a historian named Heinrich Höllerlhas. The same recipe, for the Thuringian bratwurst (one of the
                    most famous varieties), says that the makers had to use only the purest, unspoiled meat in the
                    production process.

                    Today, bratwursts are commonly served with sauerkraut, potato salad, horseradish, or mustard in
                    Germany, but the sausages are also popular in the United States, especially in Wisconsin, where they
                    are commonly found at summer cookouts and barbecues.

                    <h3>2. Pretzel</h3>
                </a>
                <p>Considered an iconic symbol of Germany, the pretzel is a type of traditional baked good that is made
                    by combining flour, salt, malt, yeast, and water. The resulting dough is then shaped into a
                    well-known knotted shape of a pretzel before it is baked.

                    Pretzels are often dipped in a lye solution (natronlauge in German) before they are baked, and then
                    they are called laugenbrezel, a Bavarian-style pretzel distinguished by a nice, brown, and crispy
                    exterior that surrounds the soft interior.

                    Coarse salt is usually sprinkled over the surface of the pretzels, but other toppings may also be
                    used, including sesame, pumpkin, sunflower, or poppy seeds. Regional variations of the pretzel
                    abound, with some of them using fat to obtain a softer dough and others calling for different types
                    of flour such as whole wheat flour or spelt flour.
